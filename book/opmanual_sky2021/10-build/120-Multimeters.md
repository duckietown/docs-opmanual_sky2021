# How to Use Multimeters {#build-multimeter status=ready}

During this step you will learn about how to use multimeters to do a continuity check and a voltage check.    

A multimeter or a multitester, also known as a VOM (volt-ohm-milliammeter), is an electronic measuring instrument that combines several measurement functions in one unit. A typical multimeter can measure voltage, current, and resistance. [This](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/all) is a general tutorial for multimeters.   
**NOTE:** Please turn off the multimeter by setting the dial to *OFF* after you finish your check.

## [**Continuity Check**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G622WDZaHg)

In electronics, a continuity check is a test of the resistance between any two points of a circuit (that it is in fact a complete circuit). If there is zero resistance between two points, then there is a **short** between the points. Shorts are potentially dangereous because they may cause far too much current to flow throughout the circuit - thus resulting in the circuit frying due to heat generated by friction.

Performing a continuity check is a safe way to debug if a circuit has an undesired short because the check does not require a power source to be connected to the circuit.

1. Select the Continuity Function
    
    * Turn the multimeter dial to the continuity test position. Then press the "FUNC." button to switch to the continuity test mode (indicated by an icon that looks like a sound wave).

        | Continuity test dial position | Continuity test mode |

    * Test the continuity test mode by touching and holding the multimeter leads together. A continuous beep will be audible for as long as the leads are held together.

2. Perform the Continuity Check  

    * Place each lead at a point of the circuit or component you want to test.

    * If the path between the two points is continuous (i.e. is a short), then the screen will display a value of zero (or near zero) and the multimeter will emit a continuous beep for as long as the leads are held in place. Note: if you hear a short beep followed by silence while the leads are held in place, then you can safely ignore the short beep.

**General Continuity Check Strategy**:

* Check every two positive (+) terminals to make sure every pair of these terminals is continuous.

* Check every two negative (-) terminals to make sure every pair of these terminals is continuous.

* Check every positive terminal (+) to make sure it is **not** continuous with any negative terminal (-).

1. **Selecting the DC Voltage Mode**  
* Switch on your multimeter, and set the dial to DC voltage mode (indicated by a V with a straight line, or the symbol ⎓).

2. **Performing the Voltage Check**  
* Place the positive (i.e. red) lead on a positive (+) terminal, and the negative (i.e. black) lead on the negative (-) terminal.  
* See the screen for a voltage measurement.   
* **NOTE:** Reversing the leads (i.e. red on - and black on +) won't do any harm; it will simply give a negative reading of the same magnitude.

## [**AC Voltage Check**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW13vjQjS5M)

1. **Selecting the AC Voltage Mode**  
* Switch on your multimeter, and set the dial to AC voltage mode (indicated by a V with a wavy line, or the symbol ṽ).  
* **NOTE:** AC voltage does not have polarity. 
* **NOTE:** Do not let your fingers touch the lead tips. Do not allow the tips to contact one another.

2. **Performing the Voltage Check**  
* Place the positive(red) lead on the positive terminal, and the negative(black) lead on the negative terminal.  
* We can get a reading from the screen now.   
* **NOTE:** Reversing the leads won't do any harm; it just gives us a negative reading.
