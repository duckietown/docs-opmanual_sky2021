**Expected Time**: 1 hours

## Preface

This section contains information about the most important skills used in the build. If you are new to soldering, it is recommended that you complete the soldering module before starting the build. Whether you're new too soldering or not, we recommend reading through this page to review the basic techniques used in the build.

## Strip Wires

**Stripping** is the process of removing a portion of insulator from a wire in order to expose its strands. It is done by using a wire stripper. The exposed wire is then able to be tinned and soldered.

## Tin

**Tinning** is the process of applying solder to exposed wire or metal pad. It is done by using a soldering iron to heat up the metal, and then solder melts into the wire or onto the pad. The purpose of Tinning is to make the soldering proecess easier.

### Tinning a Wire

See this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRPF4wpXX9Q) to learn how to tin and join two wires.


Note: Sometimes parts will have wires already tinned out-of-the-box by the manufacturer (i.e. pre-tinned). You can identify this by: 1) the "shininess" of the tip of a wire and 2) the inability to fray the wire strands of the tip of a wire. However, such tinning is often ineffective. Cut off any pre-tinned tips, then strip and tin the part yourself.

## Soldering  

Soldering is the process of joining two metal components by melting an alloy; namely, solder. Since solder is conductive, the resulting joint acts as a bridge for electricity traveling between the two metal components.

We recommend you complete the soldering module before starting the drone build to ensure you've had plenty of practice soldering practice parts before soldering your drone parts. Below, there are brief resources on soldering, as well as specific instructions for each type of soldering technique that will be used in the build.

### Safety Tips:

- Be careful holding wires and components with your bare hands while soldering, as they will get very hot very quickly. We recommend using long-nose pliers or helping hands whenever possible.

- Don't touch the soldering iron tip (or any other metal piece) while the soldering iron is on, since doing so can cause burns. If you get burned, rinse the affected area with cold water immediately.

- Likewise, don't use the soldering iron on anything you don't intend to solder. The high heat will cause things to melt or burn.

- Don't breathe soldering fumes; use a soldering fan whenever possible.

- If you have difficulty soldering (e.g. shaky hands), please seek the advice of a TA or teacher.


## Basics of electrical circuits

We recommend that you've completed the circuitry module before starting the build so that you are introduced to electrical circuits like the ones you will be creating.
